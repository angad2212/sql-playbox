## ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s Inside?
- **Database Setup**: A ready-to-use schema (`CompanyDB`) with tables for `Employees`, `Departments`, `Salaries`, `Projects`, and `Customers`.  
- **Practice Dataset**: Enough sample records to simulate real interview-style problems.  
- **30 SQL Problems** categorized by difficulty:  
  - **10 Easy** â†’ Filtering, basic `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `DISTINCT`, simple joins  
  - **15 Medium** â†’ Aggregations, multi-table joins, subqueries, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, set operations  
  - **5 Hard** â†’ Window functions, advanced subqueries, CTEs, ranking queries, and complex joins

This repo ensures you practice **all major SQL concepts**, including:

- Basic queries & filtering (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `DISTINCT`)  
- Sorting & limiting results (`ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`)
